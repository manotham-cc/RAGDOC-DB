# Chat History Feature Implementation Status

This document confirms that the chat history feature has been successfully implemented in the RAGSQL application, following the guidelines previously outlined. This enhancement provides conversational context to the AI, significantly improving the user experience.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Database Setup

A separate PostgreSQL Docker container (`chat_history_db`) has been configured to store chat history, ensuring isolation from the main application data. The `docker-compose.yml` file has been updated to include this service, and the `init-history-db.sql` script handles the automatic creation of the `chat_history` table upon container initialization.

-   **`docker-compose.yml`**: Updated to include the `chat_history_db` service.
-   **`init-history-db.sql`**: Created to define the `chat_history` table schema.

### 2. Python Code Updates

The Python application has been modified to integrate the chat history functionality across relevant modules:

-   **`ragsql/config.py`**: A new function, `get_chat_history_db_connection()`, has been added to establish connections to the dedicated chat history database.
-   **`ragsql/history.py`**: A new module has been created to encapsulate logic for saving and retrieving chat interactions from the `chat_history_db`.
-   **`main.py`**: The main application loop now manages chat sessions, generates unique session IDs, and utilizes the `save_chat_history` function to persist conversation turns.
-   **`ragsql/summary.py`**: The `get_summary` function now retrieves and incorporates chat history into the prompt sent to the Language Model (LLM) for generating user-facing summaries.
-   **`ragsql/nlq_parser.py`**: The `question_to_sql` function has been updated to accept a `session_id` and uses the chat history to provide context for generating SQL queries.
-   **`ragsql/execute_query.py`**: The `execute_sql_query` function now accepts a `session_id`, ensuring proper context propagation.

### 3. Prompt Updates

Both LLM prompts have been updated to leverage the chat history for improved contextual understanding:

-   **`prompt_templates/nl2sql_prompt.txt`**: Modified to include a `{chat_history}` placeholder, providing conversational context for SQL generation.
-   **`prompt_templates/summary_prompt.txt`**: Modified to include a `{chat_history}` placeholder, enabling the LLM to generate more relevant and context-aware summaries.

This completes the implementation of the chat history feature, making the RAGSQL application more interactive and intelligent.
